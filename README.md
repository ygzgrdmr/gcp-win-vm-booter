# gcp-win-vm-booter
This script automates the creation of a bootable disk from a snapshot and sets up a Windows VM on Google Cloud Platform. It handles the disk creation, temporary VM setup, bootable disk preparation, and final VM deployment.

## Prerequisites

   
1. **Service Account**:
   - Create a service account with the following roles:
     - `roles/compute.admin` (Compute Engine management)
     - `roles/storage.admin` (Storage bucket access if required)
   - Example command:
     gcloud iam service-accounts create my-service-account \
         --display-name="Script Service Account"

   - Assign roles:
     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
         --member="serviceAccount:my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
         --role="roles/compute.admin"

     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
         --member="serviceAccount:my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
         --role="roles/storage.admin"
     
     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
         --member="serviceAccount:my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
         --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"

2. **Startup Script**:
   - Upload the PowerShell script (`setup.ps1`) to a Cloud Storage bucket:
     gsutil cp setup.ps1 gs://your-bucket-name/
   - Update the servis account key path at: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="/path/to/your/key.json"
   - Also please updated the bucket name on the main.sh file which is SETUP_SCRIPT parameter.


3. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure the script file has execution permissions:
     chmod +x main.sh

## Customization

You can modify the following parts of the script:
